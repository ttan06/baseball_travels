# Baseball Stadium Travels

## Project Type

The plan for this project is to be a Web Application that takes in user inputs of Teams and Dates and provides potential routes and schedules for users to choose from.

## Questions

How many teams can the app handle on a schedule?
Can we optimize for distance and maybe cost?
Can we take lineup and potential starters into account to maximize enjoyment for fans?


## Goals

Create an interface that allows users to select paramaters such as weeks available, and stadiums to visit, in order to create an optimal route that satisfies all constraints. 

Stretch Goals:
Look at ticket price to see differences in price per away team
Use projected lineups to maximize "fun" (maybe day with max team WAR?, or Ace pitcher)
