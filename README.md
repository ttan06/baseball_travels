# Baseball Stadium Travels

## Project Type

The plan for this project is to be a Web Application that takes in user inputs of Teams and Dates and provides potential routes and schedules for users to choose from.

## Questions

How many teams can the app handle on a schedule?
Can we optimize for distance and maybe cost?
(Any others?)
